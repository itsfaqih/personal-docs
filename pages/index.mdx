# Faqih Muntashir's Docs

Welcome to my personal documentation site. Here you can find my notes on various topics, mostly related to web design and development.

## Tech Stack

### React

This framework is my main stack for Front End. I use this framework because it's pretty much the most mature and popular framework.
I usually install it using Vite with TypeScript:

```bash copy
npm create vite@latest my-app -- --template react-ts
```

#### Libraries

When I use React, I usually use these libraries:

- [cmdk](https://cmdk.paco.me/) - Fast, composable, unstyled command menu for React
- [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/) - Unstyled, accessible components for building high-quality design systems and web apps in React
- [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/) - Performant, flexible and extensible forms with easy-to-use validation
- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/) - Declarative routing for React
- [Tanstack Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest) - Powerful asynchronous state management
- [Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand) - A small, fast and scalable bearbones state-management solution using simplified flux principles
